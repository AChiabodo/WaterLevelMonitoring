# Water Level Monitoring Project

## Overview

This project develops a machine learning system to measure water levels. It predicts changes in water levels, helping to manage resources and prepare for disasters.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Data Preparation

- !TODO

### Configuration

- The training configuration is defined in the `configs` folder using Hydra.
- Execute `train.py` to train your model(s).

## Models Trained

This project explores various machine learning models for predicting water level changes, including:

- !TODO

## Use Cases

- **Detection**:Detect che current water level given a sensor image
- **Forecasting**: Predict future water level changes based on historical data.

## Results

Trained models and their performance metrics !TODO
